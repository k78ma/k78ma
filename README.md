Hi! I’m Kai, an undergraduate mechatronics engineering student at the University of Waterloo. </br>
</br>
I’m mainly interested in AI/ML/DL, especially in terms of their applications to robotics and autonomous systems. Specific interests include robotic perception (computer vision), motion planning (reinforcement learning, search/planning algorithms), and SLAM. Other interests are also related to this theme, including embedded programming for robotics (TinyML, RTOS) and quantum computing (quantum ML). </br>
</br>
Currently working at the Vision and Image Processing Group (UWaterloo) on [deep learning for robotic arms](https://flairop.com/). </br>
Past work: [AI-assisted medical imaging](https://github.com/k78ma/COVIDNet-Transformer) (COVID-19 Diagnosis)
